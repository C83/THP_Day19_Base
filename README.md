# THP_Day19 : Static pages

We made an application simple, basic because you're too... hum well, looked rather below

## 1. The basics

We have created a new rails app 

## 2. A little bit of formating

We made our app a little more beautiful by adding css code

## 3. Our first pages

We've created pages full of nothing with routes, used params ```as:``` to give nice nicknames to our pages, create methods, views and change the view about.html.erb

## Okay, you can

Go on our site after getting our work on github and have a little ```bundle install``` in the folder <br/>

Thank you the correctors
